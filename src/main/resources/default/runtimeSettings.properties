# This results in the following directory structure:
# 1. The wiktionary file (named "TEMP-S20110618.tsv") is directly under DATA_DIR.
# 2. It is assumed that the training and test files are stored under the the subdirectories language/corpus/train and language/corpus/test respectively.
# 2a. Raw files are assumed to be located under language/corpus/train.
# 2b. The test, training and raw files are assumed to have "test", "train" and "raw" respectively as part of their names.
# 2c. All files should obey the following rules:
#   i] One token per line, ii] use tab as separator, iii] Use new-line or ### as sentence separator token.
# 3. The universal tagset map is assumed to stored in the subdirectory "universal_pos_tags.1.02/"
# 4. Sentence-separator and tokenizer models are assumed to be located under models/.
